# Zomato NCR Data Analysis
This is my first data science project in which I try to analyse the affects of various factors on the popularity and ratings of restaurants in zomato.

## Description
You can access the [python notebook](https://github.com/pandekartik007/ZomatoDataAnalysis/blob/master/DataAnalysis.ipynb) to look at the code for the analysis. It has code for all the visualisations. 

Data is available in `data` folder. The csv dataset has a sample size of about 8000 restaurants.

## Motivation
The motivation is to get a good knowledge about restaurants in different cities in NCR

Also to know about some of the best available restaurants in the region.

## Installations
This project was done on python version 3.7.

The following libraries were used:-
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* plotly
* seaborn

## Clone repository
